# Define

A programming language based in epistemology (the study of how knowledge is
known).

The language is currently in early prototyping stages.

## Key Docs

### Language Design

- [The Conceptual Basis of Define](spec/concepts.md): The highest-level concepts
  that guide the design of Define as a language.
- [Principles for Define](spec/principles.md): A set of guiding principles for
  how we design the language, at a lower level than the Concepts, but not a
  description of a specific implementation.
- [Requirements for Define](spec/requirements.md): Similar to the Principles,
  but indicates things that must always be true about Define as a language or
  programs written in it.
- [The Define Language Specification](spec/spec.md): The detailed spec, ideally
  with sufficient information to implement a compiler for the language.
  Describes an actual programming language.

### Philosophy

[The Phillsophy of Define](philosophy.md): A document originally written in 2016
by mkanat that explains the motivations and thoughts that were originally behind
the language.

### Writing Define

Define has a basic [Style Guide](style.md) describing rules around how code
sould be structured in the language.

### Contributing

We aren't yet accepting external contributions, but I've started to collect some
docs for the future when we are, as I think about them:
