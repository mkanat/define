"""The per-action operation dependency graph (DLP 44).

Every create, move, and destroy an action performs becomes a node. Edges encode
the spec's dependency rules for position operations (the section "Deterministic
Automatic Concurrency" in the spec).

The graph also holds nodes that represent requirements and guarantees, to allow
splicing graphs together (connecting a caller's operation to the actual operations
it triggers in the callee).

It is worth understanding the difference between this and the validator's other
mechanisms that track particle states, requirements, and guarantees: this data
structure is being built to support codegen, while most other data structures
exist to support validation.

In general, operation graphs are designed such that they are the only thing
that codegen should need in order to generate code for all actions.

Operation graphs are also designed _only_ to be used by the codegen stack.
The validator must never reach back into the operation graph for any
necessary part of validation. When the compiler is called in its purely
validation mode (define validate) it should be possible to fully disable building
the operation graph and still have validation function correctly.

Operation graphs are only expected to be valid for valid Define code. None of
the code in this module needs to deal with invalid Define code, as such graphs
will never be passed to codegen. The only "invalid code" situation we might need
to care about is anything that would cause an infinite loop in this code, but
generally the validator should never even reach the operation graph's methods
in any such situation.
