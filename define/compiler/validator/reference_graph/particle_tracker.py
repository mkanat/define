        1. The callee's parent position was created by our caller, in which case
           we propagate all requirements that the current action did not satisfy.
        2. The callee's parent position was created by us (the current action) in
           which case we only propagate requirements when one of the particles
           in the callee's contracted positions came from our caller.

        To understand Case 2: it happens when the _parent_ particle of one of our
        contracted positions was moved by us (the current action) from one of our
        _own_ contracted positions. For example, let's say the requirement is on
        interface::b::c. We had our_interface with ::b::c as child positions, but
        all we did in this action is "move our_interface to interface." We don't
        actually _know_ the state of "b" and its child "c". Only our caller knows.
