# Particle Operation Maximum Safe Concurrency

These are conditional results for the serial aggregate occupancy model. They
do not establish safety or necessity for arbitrary interleavings of individual
destructions, or for destructor-induced dependency paths.

This aggregate module exposes the two independent components of maximum safe
concurrency. `calculated_schedule_execution` proves that every schedule allowed
by calculated reachability preserves the history's occupancy observations and,
for stopped histories, its final occupancy. `cover_schedule_necessity` proves
that every proper transitive subrelation permits a finite history-prefix
schedule that becomes undefined at an omitted cover pair, and extends that
counterexample to a complete schedule for both stopped and unbounded histories.
`calculated_cover_graph` proves that the calculated relation consists exactly
of the cover pairs of its reachability and is the unique inclusion-minimal
relation with that reachability. `stopped_dependency_edge_count` proves that,
for a stopped history, it is also the unique relation with the fewest edges and
that reachability.
