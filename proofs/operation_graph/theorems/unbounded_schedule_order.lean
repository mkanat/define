# Unbounded Schedule Order

This module represents a schedule indexed by the natural numbers. Such a
schedule contains every occurrence exactly once. Its finite prefixes are
duplicate-free and inherit the schedule's precedence order.

The completion theorem takes any finite prefix of the unbounded schedule and a
finite reference schedule containing it. When the reference is duplicate-free
and precedence-respecting, the prefix can be followed by the reference's other
occurrences without changing their relative reference order. The resulting
finite schedule is a precedence-respecting permutation of the reference.
