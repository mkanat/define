# Particle Operation Dependency Graph Completeness

This file formalizes the serial occupancy claim in `completeness-proof.md`:
every previous Particle Operation
whose operated positions are related to an operation's positions is reachable
through the dependency graph. The English proof is the source of the
mathematical argument; the definitions and theorems here encode that argument
for Lean to check. This claim requires the serial aggregate destruction model;
`comparison_completeness.lean` proves the separate post-Comparison reachability
result without imposing distinct recencies on simultaneous destructions.

## Formalization boundary

`CompleteResolvedDefineGraph` extends `ResolvedDefineGraph` with the
consequences of the Fill Rule's candidate selection that the minimality
theorem does not need: whenever a previous Particle Operation exists on the
filled position or one of its transitive parent positions, the Fill Rule
selected a candidate at least as recent. The Empty Rule counterpart is already
a `ResolvedDefineGraph` obligation (`latest_source_candidate`).

`calculation_correctness.lean` derives both obligations from an arbitrary valid
resolved history and its exact rule calculation. This file consumes the
resulting interface without assuming the completeness conclusion.

The proof uses induction on a natural-number occurrence bound. Each rule-stage
survivor chase and each occupancy bridge lies in the finite prefix before the
operation under consideration, so neither the history nor its vertex set must
be finite. No premise states transitive minimality or the completeness
conclusion. Characterization and uniqueness are separate results that may later
combine this theorem with independent minimality.

## Survivor chases

Each rule stage removes a candidate only in favor of another candidate that is
more recent, or that reaches the removed candidate. Following the removing
candidates therefore ascends strictly in operation order below the operation
itself, so the chase ends at a retained candidate. These lemmas package that
argument for the Comparison, the Move Correction, and the Move Rule's Fill
Dependency removal.

## Occupancy consequences

The bridge argument for a fill needs the operation that emptied the filled
position between an earlier operation on a strict child position and the fill.
These lemmas mirror `exists_occupancy_transition` and
`ValidOccupancyTrace.newly_occupied_has_operation` for the emptying direction.
