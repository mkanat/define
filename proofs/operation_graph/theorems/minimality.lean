# Particle Operation Dependency Graph Minimality

This file formalizes the English proof in
`minimality-proof.md`. The English proof is
the source of the mathematical argument; the definitions and theorems here
encode that argument for Lean to check.

## Formalization boundary

Positions are finite chained names. Graph vertices are only concrete Create,
Destroy, and Move Particle Operations. Action Requirements, Action Guarantees,
and modular destruction values are resolved before they can participate in the
dependency relation.

`RuleCalculation` encodes the former resolved-name rules in this order:

1. the Empty Rule Collection and optional Fill Dependency;
2. the simultaneous Comparison;
3. the Empty Rule's Move Correction;
4. the Move Rule's Fill Dependency removal.

`RuleGraph.exact_dependency` requires an edge exactly when this calculation
retains the dependency. The generic graph lemmas establish that adding a vertex
whose dependencies form a reachability antichain preserves transitive
minimality. The Define-specific theorems prove that every `RuleCalculation`
produces such an antichain.

No premise states that direct dependencies form an antichain, that an edge is
necessary, that the graph is acyclic, or that the graph is transitively minimal.
Every edge is proved to point to a previous operation, from which acyclicity is
derived.

## Relation to valid Define programs

`ResolvedDefineGraph` records the history and calculation premises used here:

- candidates are previous concrete Particle Operations with their specified
  position provenance;
- the position history supplies a candidate at least as recent as every
  applicable earlier operation;
- occupancy satisfies `ValidOccupancyTrace` at logical step boundaries.

`calculation_correctness.lean` machine-checks the construction of a
`ResolvedDefineGraph` from every serial `ValidResolvedHistory`. This does not
yet construct the interface from simultaneous individual destructions.
`ResolvedStepHistory` supplies their common-state occupancy facts, but the
candidate and exact-dependency construction remains separate.

A valid resolved history assigns each Particle Operation occurrence its
natural-number index and encodes each fully resolved position as a finite
chained name. The history may stop or continue without end; the theorem does not
require a finite vertex type. The occupancy state immediately before each
logical step supplies `ValidOccupancyTrace`. The source-to-history proof must
show that caller binding preserves and reflects equality and transitive
parent/child relationships and that caller and destruction resolution
contribute the concrete Particle Operations and resolved position names used by
the calculation.

`latest_source_candidate` permits the representative entry to be at the earlier
operated position or a parent position. It therefore does not require the
earlier child position to remain defined. `PositionEntryHistory` derives this
coverage from entry updates, including when a parent operation retires the
child position. The older retained-name construction supplies the special case
where the representative is at the original name.

The structure omits validity constraints unrelated to dependency minimality.
It can therefore describe abstract values that no valid Define program produces.
The theorem is conditional on its interface; accepting abstract values does not
prove that every valid Define program supplies that interface.

The non-Move source-candidate result is derived from occupancy transitions. In
particular, after an earlier Create or Destroy on a strict parent position, an
occupied source must have changed from empty to occupied at an intervening
operation. The most-recent entry for that operation's position excludes the
earlier candidate. The remaining cases cover Move dependencies and the Fill
Dependency.

Caller-prefix resolution is injective and preserves position relationships,
Particle Operation kinds, operation order, and dependency paths. The final
theorem concerns a completely resolved graph. Individual automatic destructions
use the Destroy case only once the resolved graph premises have been derived;
arbitrarily numbering simultaneous destructions does not derive them.

The separate witness file constructs a nonempty valid occupancy execution with
a Create-to-Destroy dependency. It demonstrates that the semantic obligations
are jointly satisfiable without supplying any theorem premise.
