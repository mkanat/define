# Calculated Schedule Execution

This module proves the sufficiency half of maximum safe concurrency. The
completeness component of graph characterization makes two distinct
graph-incomparable operations unrelated, which is exactly the premise required
by the adjacent schedule-exchange theorem.

The stopped-history theorem constructs the finite reference execution from the
history itself, then transfers it to every dependency-respecting schedule of
exactly the same operation occurrences. The unbounded-history theorem completes
each finite candidate prefix to a finite reference permutation and applies the
same result.
