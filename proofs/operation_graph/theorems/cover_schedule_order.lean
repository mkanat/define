# Cover-Pair Schedule Order

This module formalizes the order-theoretic part of the necessity argument for
maximum safe concurrency. A cover pair is a reachable pair with no occurrence
strictly between its endpoints. The generic definition and omitted-cover-pair
theorem are in `cover_order`. For the calculated dependency relation, every
cover pair is a related-and-previous pair.

The schedule theorem constructs a finite dependency-respecting permutation of
the history prefix ending with the later operation. Every other predecessor of
that operation appears first, followed immediately by the covered pair. All
other operations retain their relative history order. The necessity theorem
then proves that every proper transitive subrelation omits some cover pair and
allows the schedule obtained by reversing that adjacent pair.
