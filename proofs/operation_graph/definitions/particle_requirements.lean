These mathematical references preserve each selected intermediate particle.
A child still requires that particle at its preceding position: recording an
identity does not replace the actual chained reference by independent access.
Static permission to write each reference and Move geometry are separate from
this reference-observation lemma, as in `ordinary-requirements-proof.md`.
