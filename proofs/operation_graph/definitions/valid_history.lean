# Valid Resolved Particle Operation Histories

`ValidResolvedHistory` formalizes the history in `valid-history.md`. It records
the Particle Operation preconditions and exact occupancy transitions, while the
theorems below derive prefix closure, the responsible operation for newly
occupied positions, the state after a non-Move, and Move occupancy preservation.
It also records the resolved position names whose most-recent Particle
Operation may be queried at each index. It remains independent of every
operation graph rule; deriving that name trace from resolved Define source is a
separate formalization boundary.

`ExactOccupancyExecution` is the serial aggregate execution interface required
by the related-and-previous completeness argument. Minimality instead consumes
`ValidOccupancyTrace`, which can also be derived at common-state destruction
boundaries. Deriving either interface from a model does not establish that the
model represents every valid Define execution.
