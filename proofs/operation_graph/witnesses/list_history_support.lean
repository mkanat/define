# Concrete List History Support

This module removes the bookkeeping needed to present a concrete finite list of
Particle Operations as a `ValidResolvedHistory`. Occupancy still follows the
exact operation semantics. Concrete witnesses must prove every operation
precondition; this module supplies only the list indexing, the transition after
the list ends, and a queryable-name relation that accepts every position.

Universal queryability is suitable when a witness has no Moves: only positions
with earlier entries can enter an Empty Collection, so admitting unused names
does not add candidates. Witnesses with Moves should provide a narrower
queryable-name model because a Move writes entries for its queryable transitive
child positions.
