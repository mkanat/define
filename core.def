Consideration is. # a persistent creation

ViewPoint is a Consideration.
DimensionPoint is a Consideration.
Location is a Consideration. # keeping Location abstract for now

DimensionPoint has Location.

ViewPoint can Perceive a DimensionPoint:
    ViewPoint knows DimensionPoint's Location

DimensionPoint can MoveBy amount:
    modify Location by amount
DimensionPoint can MoveTo newLocation:
    modify Location by newLocation - Location

ViewPoint can create DimensionPoint.
DimensionPoint has a ViewPoint owner.
DimensionPoint must have owner.
ViewPoint has many DimensionPoint: particles.

Form is many DimensionPoint.

Know is a Attitude.

ViewPoint can Communicate using a Form or DimensionPoint named particle, a DimensionPoint named destination, a ViewPoint named recipient:
    Requirement: recipient must own destination
    ViewPoint makes particle MoveTo destination's Location
    myCopy is a duplicate of particle with:
        owner: recipient
    recipient creates Affinity with Attitude: Know, AffinityTarget: myCopy, Proximity: DimensionPoint: destination

# Compiler Concepts
#
# These are concepts that translate into something the compiler does or
# knows about. At some point we may get around to defining these
# conceptually (because they can be) but that doesn't seem like a good
# use of our time at the moment.

Number is. # can be any form of a number (integer, decimal, float, whatever)
